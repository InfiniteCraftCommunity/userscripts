# Pins and Colored Tabs
Thank you to @adrianmgg for the skeleton code from his "tweaks".

## Usage
Some organizational modifications to Infinite Craft.

## Features
- Create your own tabs to group your words.
- Color code your tabs.
- Show one, two, or more tabs at the same time.
- The same words can be added to multiple tabs, and at the same time.
- Use middle mouse click to add to tabs.

1.1.1: 
Removed about 300 lines of excess code.
There's still a small compatibility issue with [Infinite Craft Helper](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/488667-infinite-craft-helper), but it's very helpful to have that extension as well until I make a workaround.
Alt+click puts items into a 'temporary' pin section that you can use to put into your organizational tabs.
